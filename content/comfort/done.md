Poem by Edgar Albert Guest

Somebody said that it couldn’t be done<br>
But he with a chuckle replied<br>
That “maybe it couldn’t,” but he would be one<br>
Who wouldn’t say so till he’d tried.<br>
So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin<br>
On his face. If he worried he hid it.<br>
He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br>
That couldn’t be done, and he did it!

Somebody scoffed: “Oh, you’ll never do that;<br>
At least no one ever has done it;”<br>
But he took off his coat and he took off his hat<br>
And the first thing we knew he’d begun it.<br>
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,<br>
Without any doubting or quiddit,<br>
He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br>
That couldn’t be done, and he did it.

There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,<br>
There are thousands to prophesy failure,<br>
There are thousands to point out to you one by one,<br>
The dangers that wait to assail you.<br>
But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,<br>
Just take off your coat and go to it;<br>
Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing<br>
That “cannot be done,” and you’ll do it.
