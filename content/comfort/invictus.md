Poem by [William Ernest Henley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ernest_Henley)
{{< /lead >}}


Out of the night that covers me, <br>
Black as the pit from pole to pole, <br>
I thank whatever gods may be <br>
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>
I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
And yet the menace of the years<br>
Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
I am the master of my fate,<br>
I am the captain of my soul.
