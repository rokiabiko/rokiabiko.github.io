Liverpool Football Club Anthem by [Gerry and the Pacemakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_and_the_Pacemakers)
{{< /lead >}}


When you walk through a storm  
Hold your head up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark

At the end of a storm  
There's a golden sky  
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
For your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on  
With hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone

You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on  
With hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone

You'll never walk alone
