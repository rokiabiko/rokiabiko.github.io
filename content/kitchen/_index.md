Lab notes as I experiment in the kitchen. 
{{< /lead >}}

I’m keen to enhance my culinary skills this year, taking inspiration from Julie Powell’s memoir, [Julie and Julia](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/80775). The plan is to cook my way through: [Start Here](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/9661237), [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/2831178) and [Cook This Book](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/5657110). And along the way, to document my experiences, detailing what I cook, the flavors I savor, and the lessons I learn.
