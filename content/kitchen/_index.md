Lab notes as I experiment with food. 
{{< /lead >}}

One of my goals this year is to improve my culinary skills. Taking inspiration from Julie Powell’s memoir, [Julie and Julia](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/857993557), the plan is to cook my way through: [Start Here](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/1351566683), [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/952647644) and [Cook This Book](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/1245851498). And along the way, to reflect on what I cook, the flavors I savor, and the lessons I learn.
