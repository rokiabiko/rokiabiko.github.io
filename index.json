Two books I enjoyed reading this year, Americanah and Demon Copperhead, featured characters grappling with a sense of displacement, much like my own experience of being raised in one culture and now living in another. Convenience Store Woman takes this theme to an extreme, vividly portraying the struggle of being a square peg in a round-hole society.\nEarly on, we observe Keiko, the narrator, struggling to assimilate as a child. In a particular incident, she intervenes to stop a fight using an unconventional approach. Thinking this was the right thing to do, she is confused by the puzzled reactions of others. After a few such incidents, she retreats from the world as her family earnestly attempts to “fix” her.\nAt 18, Keiko stumbles upon a new convenience store and on a whim applies for a job there. For the first time, she knows exactly what is expected of her. The training manual provides clear instructions, and Keiko excels. With a model for being, she finds her place, stating, “I felt I’d become a part of the machine of society. I’ve been reborn… I actually became a normal cog in society.” She integrates more in other aspects of her life, adopting her coworkers\u0026rsquo; style of dress and speech. When asked about why she is still working at a convenience store, she resorts to using canned responses from her sister.\nNow, at 36, she feels out of place; “everyone [is] hooking up with society, either through employment or marriage” while she is not. Her family and friends subtly prod her to get a “real” job, find a man, and start a family. She observes that “the normal world has no room for exceptions and always quietly eliminates foreign objects… unless [she\u0026rsquo;s] cured, normal people will expurgate [her].”\nTo conform, she allows Shiraha - a misogynistic ex-coworker and fellow misfit - to move in with her. Despite having no affection for the other, living together is a win-win: he escapes from the world in which he feels alienated, and she can claim she has a man at home, satisfying her friends and family. “It appears that if a man and a woman are alone in an apartment together,\u0026quot; she notes, “people’s imaginations run wild, and they’re satisfied, regardless of the reality.”\nI liked how it tackled the theme of alienation and the challenges of being the odd one out. Keiko insightfully remarks, “people who are considered normal enjoy putting those who aren’t on trial.” It serves as an apt reminder not to cast judgment in spaces where we are considered “normal”.\nQuotes I’d never experienced sex, and I’d never even had any particular awareness of my own sexuality. I was indifferent to the whole thing and had never really given it any thought. And here was everyone taking it for granted that I must be miserable when I wasn’t.\nIn other words, you play the part of the fictitious creature called ‘an ordinary person’ that everyone has in them. Just like everyone in the convenience store is playing the part of the fictitious creature called ‘a store worker.\n","date":"2023-11-03","permalink":"/journal/convenience-store-woman/","section":"Journal","summary":"A review of Sayaka Murata\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://share.libbyapp.com/title/3572396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003ebook\u003c/a\u003e.","title":"Convenience Store Woman"},{"content":"\n","date":null,"permalink":"/journal/","section":"Journal","summary":"","title":"Journal"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
